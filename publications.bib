	abstract = {This paper describes a method for animating the appearance of clothing, such as pants or a shirt, that fits closely to a figure's body. Compared to flowing cloth, such as loose dresses or capes, these types of garments involve nearly continuous collision contact and small wrinkles, that can be troublesome for traditional cloth simulation methods. Based on the observation that the wrinkles in close-fitting clothing behave in a predominantly kinematic fashion, we have developed an example-based wrinkle synthesis technique. Our method drives wrinkle generation from the pose of the figure's kinematic skeleton. This approach allows high quality clothing wrinkles to be combined with a coarse cloth simulation that computes the global and dynamic aspects of the clothing motion. While the combined results do not exactly match a high-resolution reference simulation, they do capture many of the characteristic fine-scale features and wrinkles. Further, the combined system runs at interactive rates, making it suitable for applications where high-resolution offline simulations would not be a viable option. The wrinkle synthesis method uses a precomputed database built by simulating the high-resolution clothing as the articulated figure is moved over a range of poses. In principle, the space of poses is exponential in the total number of degrees of freedom; however clothing wrinkles are primarily affected by the nearest joints, allowing each joint to be processed independently. During synthesis, mesh interpolation is used to consider the influence of multiple joints, and combined with a coarse simulation to produce the final results at interactive rates.},

	abstract = {In this paper we describe a fast strain-limiting method that allows stiff, incompliant materials to be simulated efficiently. Unlike prior approaches, which act on springs or individual strain components, this method acts on the strain tensors in a coordinate-invariant fashion allowing isotropic behavior. Our method applies to both two-and three-dimensional strains, and only requires computing the singular value decomposition of the deformation gradient, either a small 2x2 or 3x3 matrix, for each element. We demonstrate its use with triangular and tetrahedral linear-basis elements. For triangulated surfaces in three-dimensional space, we also describe a complementary edge-angle-limiting method to limit out-of-plane bending. All of the limits are enforced through an iterative, non-linear, Gauss-Seidel-like constraint procedure. To accelerate convergence, we propose a novel multi-resolution algorithm that enforces fitted limits at each level of a non-conforming hierarchy. Compared with other constraint-based techniques, our isotropic multi-resolution strain-limiting method is straightforward to implement, efficient to use, and applicable to a wide range of shell and solid materials.},

	abstract = {Cloth often has complicated nonlinear, anisotropic elastic behavior due to its woven pattern and fiber properties. However, most current cloth simulation techniques simply use linear and isotropic elastic models with manually selected stiffness parameters. Such simple simulations do not allow differentiating the behavior of distinct cloth materials such as silk or denim, and they cannot model most materials with fidelity to their real-world counterparts. In this paper, we present a data-driven technique to more realistically animate cloth. We propose a piecewise linear elastic model that is a good approximation to nonlinear, anisotropic stretching and bending behaviors of various materials. We develop new measurement techniques for studying the elastic deformations for both stretching and bending in real cloth samples. Our setup is easy and inexpensive to construct, and the parameters of our model can be fit to observed data with a well-posed optimization procedure. We have measured a database of ten different cloth materials, each of which exhibits distinctive elastic behaviors. These measurements can be used in most cloth simulation systems to create natural and realistic clothing wrinkles and shapes, for a range of different materials.},

	abstract={A water drop behaves differently from a large water body because of its strong viscosity and surface tension under the small scale. Surface tension causes the motion of a water drop to be largely determined by its boundary surface. Meanwhile, viscosity makes the interior of a water drop less relevant to its motion, as the smooth velocity field can be well approximated by an interpolation of the velocity on the boundary. Consequently, we propose a fast deformable surface model to realistically animate water drops and their flowing behaviors on solid surfaces. Our system efficiently simulates water drop motions in a Lagrangian fashion, by reducing 3D fluid dynamics over the whole liquid volume to a deformable surface model. In each time step, the model uses an implicit mean curvature flow operator to produce surface tension effects, a contact angle operator to change droplet shapes on solid surfaces, and a set of mesh connectivity updates to handle topological changes and improve mesh quality over time. Our numerical experiments demonstrate a variety of physically plausible water drop phenomena at a real-time rate, including capillary waves when water drops collide, pinch-off of water jets, and droplets flowing over solid materials. The whole system performs orders-of-magnitude faster than existing simulation approaches that generate comparable water drop effects.}

The key of this method is a refinement approach that combines image-based reconstruction techniques with physically based hair simulation. Given an initially reconstructed sequence of hair fiber models, we develop a hair dynamics refinement system using particle-based simulation and incompressible fluid simulation. The system allows us to improve reconstructed hair fiber motions and complete missing fibers caused by occlusion or tracking failure. The refined space-time hair dynamics are consistent with video inputs and can be also used to generate novel hair animations of different hair styles.

	abstract = {Large-scale remote sensing images, including both satellite and aerial photographs, are widely used to render terrain scenes in real-time geographic visualization systems. Such systems often require large memories in order to store fine terrain details and fast network speeds to transfer image data, if they are built as web applications. In this paper, we propose a progressive texture compression framework to reduce the memory and bandwidth cost by compressing repeated content within and among large-scale remote sensing images. Different from existing image factorization methods, our algorithm incrementally find similar regions in new images so that large-scale images can be more efficiently compressed over time. We further propose a descriptor, the Gray Split Rotate (GSR) descriptor, to accelerate the similarity search. The reconstruction quality is finally improved by compressing residual error maps using customized S3TC-like compression. Our experiment shows that even with the error maps, our system still has higher compression rate and higher compression quality than using S3TC alone, which is a typical compression solution in most existing visualization systems.},

	abstract = {Bubbles and foams are important features of liquid surface phenomena, but they are difficult to animate due to their thin films and complex interactions in the real world. In particular, small bubbles (having diameter <1cm) in a dense foam are highly affected by surface tension, so their shapes are much less deformable compared with larger bubbles. Under this small bubble assumption, we propose a more accurate and efficient particle-based algorithm to simulate bubble dynamics and interactions. The key component of this algorithm is an approximation of foam geometry, by treating bubble particles as the sites of a weighted Voronoi diagram. The connectivity information provided by the Voronoi diagram allows us to accurately model various interaction effects among bubbles. Using Voronoi cells and weights, we can also explicitly address the volume loss issue in foam simulation, which is a common problem in previous approaches. Under this framework, we present a set of bubble interaction forces to handle miscellaneous foam behaviors, including foam structure under Plateau's laws, clusters formed by liquid surface bubbles, bubble-liquid and bubble-solid coupling, bursting and coalescing. Our experiment shows that this method can be straightforwardly incorporated into existing liquid simulators, and it can efficiently generate realistic foam animations, some of which have never been produced in graphics before.},

	abstract = {Blue noise sampling is an important component in many graphics applications, but existing techniques consider mainly the spatial positions of samples, making them less effective when handling problems with non-spatial features. Examples include biological distribution in which plant spacing is influenced by non-positional factors such as tree type and size, photon mapping in which photon flux and direction are not a direct function of the attached surface, and point cloud sampling in which the underlying surface is unknown a priori. These scenarios can benefit from blue noise sample distributions, but cannot be adequately handled by prior art.Inspired by bilateral filtering, we propose a bilateral blue noise sampling strategy. Our key idea is a general formulation to modulate the traditional sample distance measures, which are determined by sample position in spatial domain, with a similarity measure that considers arbitrary per sample attributes. This modulation leads to the notion of bilateral blue noise whose properties are influenced by not only the uniformity of the sample positions but also the similarity of the sample attributes. We describe how to incorporate our modulation into various sample analysis and synthesis methods, and demonstrate applications in object distribution, photon density estimation, and point cloud sub-sampling.},
