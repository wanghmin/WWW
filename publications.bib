	Abstract = {We present a system that allows the user to virtually try on new clothes. It uses a single commodity depth camera to capture the user in 3D. Both the pose and the shape of the user are estimated with a novel real-time template-based approach that performs tracking and shape adaptation jointly. The result is then used to drive realistic cloth simulation, in which the synthesized clothes are overlayed on the input image. The main challenge is to handle missing data and pose ambiguities due to the monocular setup, which captures less than 50 percent of the full body. Our solution is to incorporate automatic shape adaptation and novel constraints in pose tracking. The effectiveness of our system is demonstrated with a number of examples.},

abstract = {Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is efficient, mass preserving, and flexible in handling topological changes. However, sparsely sampled thin features are difficult to simulate in SPH-based free surface flows, due to a number of robustness and stability issues. In this article, we address this problem from two perspectives: the robustness of surface forces and the numerical instability of thin features. We present a new surface tension force scheme based on a free surface energy functional, under the diffuse interface model. We develop an efficient way to calculate the air pressure force for free surface flows, without using air particles. Compared with previous surface force formulae, our formulae are more robust against particle sparsity in thin feature cases. To avoid numerical instability on thin features, we propose to adjust the internal pressure force by estimating the internal pressure at two scales and filtering the force using a geometry-aware anisotropic kernel. Our result demonstrates the effectiveness of our algorithms in handling a variety of sparsely sampled thin liquid features, including thin sheets, thin jets, and water splashes.},

Larger tolerance values will introduce false positive artifacts, while smaller tolerance values may cause collisions to be undetected. The biggest issue here is that we do not know whether or when CCD will fail, even though failures are extremely rare. In this paper, we demonstrate a set of simple modifications to make a basic CCD implementation failure-proof. Using error analysis, we prove the safety of this method and we formulate suggested tolerance values to reduce false positives.

In this approach, we first build coarse correspondences between the template mesh and the point cloud through a squeezed spectral embedding technique that exploits human body extremities. Based on these correspondences, we define the goal of non-rigid registration using an elastic energy functional and apply a discrete gradient flow to reduce the difference between a coarse control mesh and the point cloud. The deformed template mesh can then be obtained from the deformation of the control mesh using mean value coordinates afterwards. Our experiments show (see the supplementary video) that the approach is capable of equipping a mesh with the pose of a scanned point cloud data even if it is incomplete and noisy.}

To determine the thickness of the ideal interface during fluid mixing, we perform theoretical analysis on a one-dimensional diffusive model using the Fick's law of diffusion. By explicitly controlling the interface thickness using a spatio-temporally varying kernel variable, we can use our scheme to produce realistic fluid mixing effects without numerical dissipation artifacts. We can also use the scheme to control interface changes between two fluids, due to temperature, pressure, or external energy input. This convection scheme is compatible with many advection methods and it has a small computational overhead.},

Based on this representation, we develop a variety of techniques to ensure the performance and robustness of our simulator under large time steps, including brush and particle simulations in non-inertial frames, a fixed-point method for accelerating Jacobi iterations, and a new Eulerian-Lagrangian approach for simulating detailed liquid effects. The resulting system can realistically simulate not only the motions of brush bristles and paint liquid, but also the liquid transfer processes among different representations.

In this paper, we present a new domain decomposition framework that connects two disjoint domains through coupling elements.

Since the coupling elements are part of the deformable body, their elastic properties are the same as the rest of the body and our system does not need stiffness parameter tuning. To quickly evaluate the reduced elastic forces and their Jacobian matrices caused by the coupling elements, we further develop two cubature optimization schemes using uniform and non-uniform cubature weights. Our experiment shows that the whole system can efficiently handle large and complex scenes, many of which cannot be easily simulated by previous techniques without limitations.},

In this paper, we present a systematic study on the partitioning and packing of 3D models under the multi-phase level set framework. We first construct analysis tools to evaluate the qualities of a partitioning using six metrics: stress load, surface details, interface area, packed size, printability, and assembling. Based on this analysis, we then formulate level set methods to improve the qualities of the partitioning according to the metrics. These methods are integrated into an automatic system, which repetitively and locally optimizes the partitioning. Given the optimized partitioning result, we further provide a container structure modeling algorithm to facilitate the packing process of the printed pieces. Our experiment shows that the system can generate quality partitioning of various 3D models for space saving and fast production purposes.},

However, using linear modal analysis to calculate the basis from scratch is known to be computationally expensive. In the paper, we show that the subspace of a modified body can be efficiently obtained from the subspace of its original version, if mesh changes are small. Our basic idea is to approximate the stiffness matrix by its low-frequency component, so we can calculate new linear deformation modes by solving an incremental eigenvalue decomposition problem. To further handle nonlinear deformations in the subspace, we present a hybrid approach to calculate modal derivatives from both new and original linear modes. Finally, we demonstrate that the cubature samples trained for the original mesh can be reused in fast reduced force and stiffness matrix evaluation, and we explore the use of our techniques in various simulation problems. Our experiment shows that the updated subspace basis still allows a simulator to generate visual plausible deformation effects. The whole system is efficient and it is compatible with other subspace construction approaches.},

An effective solution is to hollow the 3D model into a shell and print the shell by parts. Unfortunately, making shell pieces tightly assembled and easy to disassemble seem to be two contradictory conditions, and there exists no easy way to satisfy them at the same time yet. In this paper, we present a computational system to design an interlocking structure of a partitioned shell model, which uses only male and female connectors to lock shell pieces in the assembled configuration. Given a mesh segmentation input, our system automatically finds an optimal installation plan specifying both the installation order and the installation directions of the pieces, and then builds the models of the shell pieces using optimized shell thickness and connector sizes. To find the optimal installation plan, we develop simulation-based and data-driven metrics, and we incorporate them into an optimal plan search algorithm with fast pruning and local optimization strategies. The whole system is automatic, except for the shape design of the key piece. The interlocking structure does not introduce new gaps on the outer surface, which would become noticeable inevitably due to limited printer precision. Our experiment shows that the assembled object is strong against separation, yet still easy to disassemble.},

Using this system, the user can choose to edit the rest shape or the quasistatic shape of an elastic solid, and obtain the other shape that matches under the quasistatic equilibrium condition at the same time. The development of this system is based on the discovery that inverse quasistatic simulation can be immediately solved by Newton's method with a direct solver. To implement our simulator, we propose a Jacobian matrix evaluation scheme for the inverse elastic problem and we present step length and matrix evaluation techniques that improve the simulation performance. While our simulator is efficient, it is still not fast enough for the system to generate the result in real time. Our solution is a shape initialization method using the recent projective dynamics technique. Shape initialization not only works as a fast preview function during the user editing process, but also speeds up the convergence of quasistatic or inverse quasistatic simulation afterwards. The use of a heterogeneous algorithm structure allows the system to further reduce its preview cost, by utilizing the power of both the CPU and the GPU. Our experiment demonstrates that the whole system is fast, robust, and convenient for the designer to use in both forward and inverse elastic shape design.

As single-resolution simulation starts to reach the limit of computational power, we believe the future of cloth simulation is in multi-resolution simulation. In this paper, we explore nonlinearity, adaptive smoothing, and parallelization under a full multigrid (FMG) framework. The foundation of this research is a novel nonlinear FMG method for unstructured meshes. To introduce nonlinearity into FMG, we propose to formulate the smoothing process at each resolution level as the computation of a search direction for the original high-resolution nonlinear optimization problem. We prove that our nonlinear FMG is guaranteed to converge under various conditions and we investigate the improvements to its performance. We present an adaptive smoother which is used to reduce the computational cost in the regions with low residuals already. Compared to normal iterative solvers, our nonlinear FMG method provides faster convergence and better performance for both Newton's method and Projective Dynamics. Our experiment shows our method is efficient, accurate, stable against large time steps, and friendly with GPU parallelization. The performance of the method has a good scalability to the mesh resolution, and the method has good potential to be combined with multi-resolution collision handling for real-time simulation in the future.},

abstract = {Elastic parameter optimization has revealed its importance in 3D modeling, virtual reality, and additive manufacturing in recent years. Unfortunately, it is known to be computationally expensive, especially if there are many parameters and data samples. To address this challenge, we propose to introduce the inexactness into descent methods, by iteratively solving a forward simulation step and a parameter update step in an inexact manner. The development of such inexact descent methods is centered at two questions: 1) how accurate/inaccurate can the two steps be; and 2) what is the optimal way to implement an inexact descent method. The answers to these questions are in our convergence analysis, which proves the existence of relative error thresholds for the two inexact steps to ensure the convergence. This means we can simply solve each step by a fixed number of iterations, if the iterative solver is at least linearly convergent. While the use of the inexact idea speeds up many descent methods, we specifically favor a GPU-based one powered by state-of-the-art simulation techniques. Based on this method, we study a variety of implementation issues, including backtracking line search, initialization, regularization, and multiple data samples. We demonstrate the use of our inexact method in elasticity measurement and design applications. Our experiment shows the method is fast, reliable, memory-efficient, GPU-friendly, flexible with different elastic models, scalable to a large parameter space, and parallelizable for multiple data samples.},

abstract = {Being able to customize sewing patterns for different human bodies without using any pre-defined adjustment rule will not only improve the realism of virtual humans in the entertainment industry, but also deeply affect the fashion industry by making fast fashion and made-to-measure garments more accessible. To meet the requirement set by the fashion industry, a sewing pattern adjustment system must be both efficient and precise, which unfortunately cannot be achieved by existing techniques. In this paper, we propose to solve sewing pattern adjustment as a nonlinear optimization problem immediately, rather than in two phases: a garment shape optimization phase and an inverse pattern design phase as in previous systems. This allows us to directly minimize the objective function that evaluates the fitting quality of the garment sewn from a pattern, without any compromise caused by the nonexistence of the solution to inverse pattern design. To improve the efficiency of our system, we carry out systematic research on a variety of optimization topics, including pattern parametrization, initialization, an inexact strategy, acceleration, and CPU-GPU implementation. We verify the usability of our system through automatic grading tests and made-to-measure tests. Designers and pattern makers confirm that our pattern results are able to preserve design details and their fitting qualities are acceptable. In our computational experiment, the system further demonstrates its efficiency, reliability, and flexibility of handling various pattern designs. While our current system still needs to overcome certain limitations, we believe it is a crucial step toward fully automatic pattern design and adjustment in the future.},

abstract = {We propose a framework for the interactive simulation of nonlinear deformable objects. The primary feature of our system is the seamless integration of deformable simulation and collision culling, which are often independently handled in existing animation systems. The bridge connecting them is the medial axis transform (MAT), a high-fidelity volumetric approximation of complex 3D shapes. From the physics simulation perspective, MAT leads to an expressive and compact reduced nonlinear model. We employ a semireduced projective dynamics formulation, which well captures high-frequency local deformations of high-resolution models while retaining a low computation cost. Our key observation is that the most compelling (nonlinear) deformable effects are enabled by the local constraints projection, which should not be aggressively reduced, and only apply model reduction at the global stage. From the collision detection (CD)/collision culling (CC) perspective, MAT is geometrically versatile using linear-interpolated spheres (i.e., the so-called medial primitives (MPs)) to approximate the boundary of the input model. The intersection test between two MPs is formulated as a quadratically constrained quadratic program problem. We give an algorithm to solve this problem exactly, which returns the deepest penetration between a pair of intersecting MPs. When coupled with spatial hashing, collision (including self-collision) can be efficiently identified on the GPU within a few milliseconds even for massive simulations. We have tested our system on a variety of geometrically complex and high-resolution deformable objects, and our system produces convincing animations with all of the collisions/self-collisions well handled at an interactive rate.},

Our system adopts a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) trained with physics-based simulation data to produce raw liquid splash models from input sketches, and then applies model refinement processes to further improve their small-scale details. The system considers not only the trajectory of every user stroke, but also its speed, which makes the splash model simulation-ready with its underlying 3D flow. Compared with simulation-based modeling techniques through trials and errors, our system offers flexibility, convenience and intuition in liquid splash design and editing. We evaluate the usability and the efficiency of our system in an immersive virtual reality environment. Thanks to this system, an amateur user can now generate a variety of realistic liquid splashes in just a few minutes.},

abstract = {Cloth dynamics and collision handling are the two most challenging topics in cloth simulation. While researchers have substantially improved the performances of cloth dynamics solvers recently, their success in fast collision detection and handling is rather limited. In this article, we focus our research on the safety, efficiency, and realism of the repulsion-based collision handling approach, which has demonstrated its potential in existing GPU-based simulators. Our first discovery is the necessary vertex distance conditions for cloth to enter self intersections, the negations of which can be viewed as vertex distance constraints continuous in time for sufficiently avoiding self collisions. Continuous constraints, however, cannot be enforced with ease. Our solution is to convert continuous constraints into three types of constraints: discrete edge length constraints, discrete vertex distance constraints, and vertex displacement constraints. Based on this solution, we develop a fast and safe collision handling process for enforcing constraints, a novel splitting method for integrating collision handling with dynamics solvers, and static and adaptive remeshing schemes to further improve the runtime performance. In summary, our cloth simulator is efficient, safe, robust, and parallelizable on a GPU. The experiment shows that it runs at least one order of magnitude faster than existing simulators.},

State-of-the-art simulation techniques, mostly developed for unstructured triangular meshes, can hardly meet this demand due to their large computational costs and memory footprints. We argue that in a very high resolution, it is more plausible to use regular meshes with an underlying grid structure, which can be highly compatible with GPU acceleration like high-resolution images. Based on this idea, we formulate and solve the nonlinear optimization problem for simulating high-resolution wrinkles, by a fast block-based descent method with reduced memory accesses. We also investigate the development of the collision handling component in our system, whose performance benefits greatly from the grid structure. Finally, we explore various issues related to the applications of our system, including initialization for fast convergence and temporal coherence, gathering effects, inflation and stuffing models, and mesh simplification. We can treat our system as a quasistatic wrinkle synthesis tool, run it as a standalone dynamic simulator, or integrate it into a multi-resolution solver as an additional component. The experiment demonstrates the capability, efficiency and flexibility of our system in producing a variety of high-resolution wrinkles effects.},

Similar to other preconditioners under the MAS framework, our preconditioner naturally adopts multilevel and domain decomposition concepts. But contrary to previous works, we advocate the use of small, non-overlapping domains that can well explore the parallel computing power on a GPU. Based on this idea, we investigate and invent a series of algorithms for our preconditioner, including multilevel domain construction using Morton codes, low-cost matrix precomputation by one-way Gauss-Jordan elimination, and conflict-free symmetric-matrix-vector multiplication in runtime preconditioning. The experiment shows that our preconditioner is effective, fast, cheap to precompute and scalable with respect to stiffness and problem size. It is compatible with many linear and nonlinear solvers used in cloth and deformable body simulation with dynamic contacts, such as PCG, accelerated gradient descent and L-BFGS. On a GPU, our preconditioner speeds up a PCG solver by approximately a factor of four, and its CPU version outperforms a number of competitors, including ILU0 and ILUT.},

abstract = {Real-world fabrics often possess complicated nonlinear, anisotropic bending stiffness properties. Measuring the physical parameters of such properties for physics-based simulation is difficult yet unnecessary, due to the persistent existence of numerical errors in simulation technology. In this work, we propose to adopt a simulation-in-the-loop strategy: instead of measuring the physical parameters, we estimate the simulation parameters to minimize the discrepancy between reality and simulation. This strategy offers good flexibility in test setups, but the associated optimization problem is computationally expensive to solve by numerical methods. Our solution is to train a regression-based neural network for inferring bending stiffness parameters, directly from drape features captured in the real world. Specifically, we choose the Cusick drape test method and treat multiple-view depth images as the feature vector. To effectively and efficiently train our network, we develop a highly expressive and physically validated bending stiffness model, and we use the traditional cantilever test to collect the parameters of this model for 618 real-world fabrics. Given the whole parameter data set, we then construct a parameter subspace, generate new samples within the sub-space, and finally simulate and augment synthetic data for training purposes. The experiment shows that our trained system can replace cantilever tests for quick, reliable and effective estimation of simulation-ready parameters. Thanks to the use of the system, our simulator can now faithfully simulate bending effects comparable to those in the real world.},

abstract = {Step-and-project is a popular method to simulate non-penetrating deformable bodies in physically based animation. The strategy is to first integrate the system in time without considering contacts and then resolve potential intersections, striking a good balance between plausibility and efficiency. However, existing methods can be defective and unsafe when using large time steps, taking risks of failure or demanding repetitive collision testing and resolving that severely degrade performance. In this article, we propose a novel two-way method for fast and reliable continuous collision handling. Our method launches an optimization from both ends of the intermediate time-integrated state and the previous intersection-free state. It progressively generates a piecewise linear path and eventually obtains a feasible solution for the next time step. The algorithm efficiently alternates between a forward step and a backward step until the result is conditionally converged. Thanks to a set of unified volume-based contact constraints, our method offers flexible and reliable handling of various codimensional deformable bodies, including volumetric bodies, cloth, hair, and sand. Experimental results demonstrate the safety, robustness, physical fidelity, and numerical efficiency of our method, making it particularly suitable for scenarios involving large deformations or large time steps.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a GPU algorithm for finite element hyperelastic simulation. We show that the interior-point method, known to be effective for robust collision resolution, can be coupled with non-Newton procedures and be massively sped up on the GPU. Newton's method has been widely chosen for the interior-point family, which fully solves a linear system at each step. After that, the active set associated with collision/contact constraints is updated. Mimicking this routine using a non-Newton optimization (like gradient descent or ADMM) unfortunately does not deliver expected accelerations. This is because the barrier functions employed in an interior-point method need to be updated at every iteration to strictly confine the search to the feasible region. The associated cost (e.g., per-iteration CCD) quickly overweights the benefit brought by the GPU, and a new parallelism modality is needed. Our algorithm is inspired by the domain decomposition method and designed to move interior-point-related computations to local domains as much as possible. We minimize the size of each domain (i.e., a stencil) by restricting it to a single element, so as to fully exploit the capacity of modern GPUs. The stencil-level results are integrated into a global update using a novel hybrid sweep scheme. Our algorithm is locally second-order offering better convergence. It enables simulation acceleration of up to two orders over its CPU counterpart. We demonstrate the scalability, robustness, efficiency, and quality of our algorithm in a variety of simulation scenarios with complex and detailed collision geometries.},

abstract = {We propose an efficient cloth simulation method that combines the merits of two drastically different numerical procedures, namely the subspace integration and parallelizable iterative relaxation. We show those two methods can be organically coupled within the framework of projective dynamics (PD), where both low- and high-frequency cloth motions are effectively and efficiently computed. Our method works seamlessly with the state-of-the-art contact handling algorithm, the incremental potential contact (IPC), to offer the non-penetration guarantee of the resulting animation. Our core ingredient centers around the utilization of subspace for the expedited convergence of Jacobi-PD. This involves solving the reduced global system and smartly employing its precomputed factorization. In addition, we incorporate a time-splitting strategy to handle the frictional self-contacts. Specifically, during the PD solve, we employ a quadratic proxy to approximate the contact barrier. The prefactorized subspace system matrix is exploited in a reduced-space LBFGS. The LBFGS method starts with the reduced system matrix of the rest shape as the initial Hessian approximation, incorporating contact information into the reduced system progressively, while the full-space Jacobi iteration captures high-frequency details. Furthermore, we address penetration issues through a penetration correction step. It minimizes an incremental potential without elasticity using Newton-PCG. Our method can be efficiently executed on modern GPUs. Experiments show significant performance improvements over existing GPU solvers for high-resolution cloth simulation.},

abstract = {In this paper, we address two limitations of dihedral angle based discrete bending (DAB) models, i.e. the indefiniteness of their energy Hessian and their vulnerability to geometry degeneracies. To tackle the indefiniteness issue, we present novel analytic expressions for the eigensystem of a DAB energy Hessian. Our expressions reveal that DAB models typically have positive, negative, and zero eigenvalues, with four of each, respectively. By using these expressions, we can efficiently project an indefinite DAB energy Hessian as positive semi-definite analytically. To enhance the stability of DAB models at degenerate geometries, we propose rectifying their indefinite geometric stiffness matrix by using orthotropic geometric stiffness matrices with adaptive parameters calculated from our analytic eigensystem. Among the twelve motion modes of a dihedral element, our resulting Hessian for DAB models retains only the desirable bending modes, compared to the undesirable altitude-changing modes of the exact Hessian with original geometric stiffness, all modes of the Gauss-Newton approximation without geometric stiffness, and no modes of the projected Hessians with inappropriate geometric stiffness. Additionally, we suggest adjusting the compression stiffness according to the Kirchhoff-Love thin plate theory to avoid over-compression. Our method not only ensures the positive semidefiniteness but also avoids instability caused by large bending forces at degenerate geometries. To demonstrate the benefit of our approaches, we show comparisons against existing methods on the simulation of cloth and thin plates in challenging examples.},
