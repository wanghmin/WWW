abstract: Physically based animation of detailed fracture effects is not only computationally
  expensive, but also difficult to implement due to numerical instability. In this
  paper, we propose a physics-inspired approach to enrich low-resolution fracture
  animation by realistic fracture details. Given a custom-designed material strength
  field, we adaptively refine a coarse fracture surface into a detailed one, based
  on a discrete gradient descent flow. Using the new fracture surface, we then generate
  a high-resolution fracture animation with details on both the fracture surface and
  the exterior surface. Our experiment shows that this approach is simple, fast, and
  friendly to user design and control. It can generate realistic fracture animations
  within a few seconds.
