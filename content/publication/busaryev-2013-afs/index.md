abstract: The fractures of thin plates often exhibit complex physical behaviors in
  the real world. In particular, fractures caused by tearing are different from fractures
  caused by in-plane motions. In this paper, we study how to make thin-plate fracture
  animations more realistic from three perspectives. We propose a stress relaxation
  method, which is applied to avoid shattering artifacts after generating each fracture
  cut. We formulate a fracture-aware remeshing scheme based on constrained Delaunay
  triangulation, to adaptively provide more fracture details. Finally, we use our
  multi-layered model to simulate complex fracture behaviors across thin layers. Our
  experiment shows that the system can efficiently and realistically simulate the
  fractures of multi-layered thin plates.
