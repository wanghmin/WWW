abstract: So far extending light field rendering to dynamic scenes has been trivially
  treated as the rendering of static light fields stacked in time. This type of approaches
  requires input video sequences in strict synchronization and allows only discrete
  exploration in the temporal domain determined by the capture rate. In this paper
  we propose a novel framework, space-time light field rendering, which allows continuous
  exploration of a dynamic scene in both spatial and temporal domain with unsynchronized
  input video sequences. In order to synthesize novel views from any viewpoint at
  any time instant, we develop a two-stage rendering algorithm. We first interpolate
  in the temporal domain to generate globally synchronized images using a robust spatial-temporal
  image registration algorithm followed by edge-preserving image morphing. We then
  interpolate those software-synchronized images in the spatial domain to synthesize
  the final view. Our experimental results show that our approach is robust and capable
  of maintaining photo-realistic results.
summary: We propose a novel framework, space-time light field rendering, which allows continuous
  exploration of a dynamic scene in both spatial and temporal domain with unsynchronized
  input video sequences.
