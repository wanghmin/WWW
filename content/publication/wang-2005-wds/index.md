abstract: We present a physically-based method to enforce contact angles at the intersection
  of fluid free surfaces and solid objects, allowing us to simulate a variety of small-scale
  fluid phenomena including water drops on surfaces. The heart of this technique is
  a virtual surface method, which modifies the level set distance field representing
  the fluid surface in order to maintain an appropriate contact angle. The surface
  tension that is calculated on the contact line between the solid surface and liquid
  surface can then capture all interfacial tensions, including liquid-solid, liquid-air
  and solid-air tensions. We use a simple dynamic contact angle model to select contact
  angles according to the solid material property, water history, and the fluid front's
  motion. Our algorithm robustly and accurately treats various drop shape deformations,
  and handles both flat and curved solid surfaces. Our results show that our algorithm
  is capable of realistically simulating several small-scale liquid phenomena such
  as beading and flattened drops, stretched and separating drops, suspended drops
  on curved surfaces, and capillary action.
summary: We present a physically-based method to enforce contact angles at the intersection
  of fluid free surfaces and solid objects, allowing us to simulate a variety of small-scale
  fluid phenomena including water drops on surfaces.
